# Welcome to my solution showcase! ðŸ‘‹

This is a collection of my solutions to the challenges on Frontend Mentor. The goal of Frontend Mentor challenges is to replicate the given design as close as possible.

On the website, each project has three links: Github, Live, and Frontend Mentor solutions page. I documented every project I did on each of the project Github links. I share what the design looks like, challenges I faced, what I learned, and time spent on each project. Note that I started doing these projects back when I started to learn web development so some of the solutions are not the best, but it's a great way to look back and see how far I've come.

## Inpiration

I wanted to update the home of all my solutions so I created this website. I will be updating this page as I complete more challenges. This new solutions showcase was created in March 2023 with the theme/goal of being big and bold. I also added some animations to make it more interesting (a way to practice my CSS skills and animations).
